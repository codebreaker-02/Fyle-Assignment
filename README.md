# GitHub Profile Explorer
GitHub Profile Explorer is a web application that allows you to explore GitHub profiles, view user details, and navigate through repositories seamlessly.

## How to Run

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codebreaker-02/Fyle-Assignment.git

   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Fyle-Assignment

   ```

3. Open the index.html file using a live server. If you don't have a live server extension, you can install one for your code editor or use a tool like Live Server for Visual Studio Code.

Once the application is running, you'll see the search page. Enter the GitHub username of the profile you want to explore in the search bar and click the "Search User" button.

The application will fetch the user details and repositories from GitHub. You can navigate through the user's repositories using the pagination controls.
